        <p>Today I went to the <span>programming</span> club. This is the first time I went since she died. When I walked in, I was struck with memories of us going together after class. I still remember your smile, your laugh, and the silly face you always made when you were frustrated. Today we were working on <span>web development</span> – your favorite. You were so bad at it, you always ended up asking me or just going on <span>Facebook</span> the entire time. I would get frustrated at you and tell you to do your own work, to take it seriously. But now it is lonely without you there. We have new students who have joined and are just as hopeless as you were, but it isn’t the same. I miss you. But I know you would just laugh at me and tell me to brighten up.</p>

            <p>I joined the <span>programming</span> club today. Met @... there, looking forward to learning more and getting to know all the people. Was so much fun! We started working on a <span>web development</span> project. Hopefully it will be finished by the end of this year so I can show you all :D</p>
